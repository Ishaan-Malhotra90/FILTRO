# FILTRO

**Project Overview:**

FILTRO is designed to process tab-separated text files generated by a server and convert them into Excel (.xlsx) format. The conversion allows for easier manipulation and analysis of the data. The project also includes a summarization feature to analyze the data based on specific criteria.

**Features:**

1. **Data Conversion:**
   - Converts tab-separated text files to Excel (.xlsx) format.

2. **Data Summarization:**
   - **IP Address Presence:** Identifies if an IP address is present in all files. If not, it determines in how many files the IP address is missing.
   - **Response Errors:** Counts occurrences of response errors, where both `fld3` and `fld4` are empty.
   - **Connection Errors:** Counts occurrences of connection errors, where `PRIMKEY` is empty.

3. **Summary Generation:**
   - Produces a summary report in Excel format with the above analyses.

**User Interface:**

- **Web App:** Provides an interface for file upload and summary generation. Users can easily convert files and obtain the summarized data at the press of a button.

**Example Data:**
